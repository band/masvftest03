in a new repository.

what were the steps?
1. create new repo w/ Github web interface
2. start up Github Desktop and sign-in
3. clone new repo from list available
4. add a .gitignore file to the cloned repo; commit and push
5. add repo as a new vault in Obsidian
6. install Obsidian-Git plugin to the new vault
7. set options for Obsidian-Git ("git:ready" shows up in bottom bar)
8. create a new file (this one!)
    let's see what happens
	
	
9. very confused by using GIthub Desktop for cloning and I get newrepo/newrepo and the git stuff split between two directories.
    Nota Bene: cloning always makes the repo directory. Sigh.
10. So we will save this file somewhere and start over again. Maybe rest first?
